# Max the Library Bat

This is a private library with the general features we use in every Hedgehog2.0 related project.
This allows us to prevent using duplicated, and potentially out of date, code.

## Wait, but this is public?

Yep, easier for us that way. This project doesn't really contain anything secretive, so we decided to make the repository
public. Yes, that also means this isn't an accident.

Please don't get confused. This **isn't** "open-sourcing", per-say. There is no open source license attached to this code.
Meaning you're technically not allowed to use this. But, it's not like we're going to sue you or anything, so if you really
have to use this code, just use it.
